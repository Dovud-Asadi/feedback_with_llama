Not only one people, you can send it in the first time to ten or more people. It's so fast and more comfortable than by phone. These people check their email very fast.

The use of cohesive devices is minimal, and transitions between ideas are often abrupt or unclear.\\n\\nFluency: The candidate hesitates frequently, repeats words (\\\"I really like to wear the jewelry\\\"), and self-corrects often, which disrupts the flow of speech. There are also instances of incomplete sentences and unclear thoughts, especially in Part 2, which affects the overall fluency.\\n\\nVocabulary: The range of vocabulary is limited, and there are instances of incorrect word choices (\\\"beasters\\\" instead of \\\"beads\\\" or \\\"gemstones\\\"). The candidate could benefit from using a wider range of topic-specific vocabulary and more precise terms.\\n\\nGrammar: There are numerous grammatical mistakes, including incorrect verb tenses (\\\"I should wear the jewelry\\\"), subject-verb agreement issues (\\\"this jewelry they can, they can, they can remain about something\\\"), and incorrect sentence structures. The use of modal verbs is also incorrect at times (\\\"I wouldn't to enter\\\").\\n\\nPronunciation: The transcript does not provide enough information to accurately assess pronunciation.\\n\\nBand score:5.0 \\nFluency: 5.0\\nVocabulary: 5.0\\nGrammar: 4.5\\nPronunciation: 5.0\\n\\nSpecific topic-words used by candidate (worth-to-mention):\\n- Jewelry\\n- Chain\\n- Bracelet\\n- Ring\\n- Brilliant\\n\\nSuggested less used topic-related words, idioms or collocations:\\n- Accessorize (as a verb, e.g., \\\"I like to accessorize with jewelry.\\\")\\n- Gemstones (instead of \\\"brilliant\\\")\\n- Keepsake (for a piece of jewelry with sentimental value)\\n- Timepiece (for a watch)\\n- Heirloom (for jewelry passed down through generations)\\n- \\\"Lose track of\\\" (instead of \\\"lose this jewelry\\\")\\n- \\\"Misplace\\\" (a more accurate verb for losing something)\\n- \\\"Cherished gift\\\" (instead of \\\"someone present to me\\\")\\n- \\\"Hold sentimental value\\\" (instead of \\\"they can remain about something\\\")\n",
